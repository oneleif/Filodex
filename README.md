# Filodex

Starting and running a non-profit organization can be an intimidating process. Information and resources are often spread across multiple channels and best practices are seldom recorded for others to follow.

Filodex is aiming to bridge this gap by building a centralized repository of knowledge, tools, funding opportunities, and other resources for individuals in the non-profit sector.
